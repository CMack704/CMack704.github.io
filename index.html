                <p>Hello! I am from Belmont, NC, currently live in Gastonia, NC. I graduated from South Point high school in 2000. I decided then to go into retail sales and not go to college. I have been in retail for 18 years mainly between Best Buy and T-Mobile. I am always trying to learn something new. I started messing around on code academy and thought I would like to do this for a profession, and now here I am starting a new journey!
